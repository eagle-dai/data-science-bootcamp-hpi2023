    "- After 60 minutes of inactivity the data is deleted to free up resources for other users.\n",
    "- Therefore, please save the notebook locally (click \"File\" -> \"Download\") if you are pausing your work on the notebook for more than one hour. (We have put a reminder to save the notebook after each task.)\n",

Till the due date (which is **the 27th of June (11:55 pm / 23:55 UTC**), you can revise your answers.
